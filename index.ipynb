You saw how a one sample t-test can be applied to contexts where the population mean is unknown and you have a limited amount of sample data. You looked at all the stages required for such hypothesis testing with a description of steps and also, how to perform these functions in Python. The lesson also briefly explains the comparison of using p-value for statistical significance vs. effect sizes.
